msgid "Ren'Py now supports hotspot caching for screen language imagemaps. When :var:`config.developer` is true, Ren'Py will write a PNG file in the game/cache/ directory containing image data for each of the hotspots in the imagemap. If the cache file exists (regardless of the config.developer setting) it will be loaded instead of loading the hotspot images. As the cache file is often much smaller than the size of the hotspot images, it will load faster and reduce image cache pressure, improving game performance. This behavior only applies to screen language imagemaps, and can be disabled with :var:`config.imagemap_cache`."
