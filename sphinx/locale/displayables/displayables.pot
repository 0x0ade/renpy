msgid "The im.MatrixColor image manipulator is an image manipulator that uses a matrix to control how the colors of an image are transformed. The matrix used can be an im.matrix object, which encodes a 5x5 matrix in an object that supports matrix multiplication, and is returned by a series of functions. im.matrix objects may be multiplied together to yield a second object that performs both operations. For example, the code::"
