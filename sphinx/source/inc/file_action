.. function:: FileAction(name, page=None)
    
    "Does the right thing" with the file. This means loading it if the
    load screen is showing, and saving to it otherwise.

.. function:: FileDelete(name, confirm=True, page=None)
    
    Deletes the file.
    
    `confirm`
        If true, prompts before deleting a file.

.. function:: FileLoad(name, confirm=True, page=None)
    
    Loads the file.
    
    `confirm`
        If true, prompt if loading the file will end the game.

.. function:: FilePage(page)
    
    Sets the file page to `page`, which should be one of "auto", "quick",
    or an integer.

.. function:: FilePageNext(max=None)
    
    Goes to the next file page.
    
    `max`
        If set, this should be an integer that gives the number of
        the maximum file page we can go to.

.. function:: FilePagePrevious(self)
    
    Goes to the previous file page, if possible.

.. function:: FileSave(name, confirm=True, newest=True, page=None)

    The button with this slot is selected if it's marked as the
    newest save file.
    
    `confirm`
        If true, then we will prompt before overwriting a file.
    
    `newest`
        If true, then this file will be marked as the newest save
        file when it's saved. (Set this to false for a quicksave,
        for example.)

.. function:: FileTakeScreenshot()
    
    Take a screenshot to be used when the game is saved. This can
    be used to ensure that the screenshot is accurate, by taking
    a pictue of the screen before a file save screen is shown.
