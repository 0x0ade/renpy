.. function:: Text(text, slow=None, scope=None, substitute=None, slow_done=None, **properties)
    
    A displayable that displays text on the screen.
    
    `text`
        The text to display on the screen. This may be a string, or a list of 
        strings and displayables.
        
    `slow`
        Determines if the text is displayed slowly, being typed out one character at the time.  
        If None, slow text mode is determined by the :propref:`slow_cps` style property. Otherwise,
        the truth value of this parameter determines if slow text mode is used.
    
    `scope`
        If not None, this should be a dictionary that provides an additional scope for text
        interpolation to occur in. 
        
    `substitute`
        If true, text interpolation occurs. If false, it will not occur. If
        None, they are controlled by :var:`config.new_substitutions`.
