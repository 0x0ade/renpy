.. class:: renpy.register_sl_statement(name, positional=0, children='many', screen=None)
    
    Registers a custom screen language statement with Ren'Py.
    
    `name`
        This must be a word. It's the name of the custom screen language
        statement.
    
    `positional`
        The number of positional parameters this statement takes.
    
    `children`
        The number of children this custom statement takes. This should
        be 0, 1, or "many", which means zero or more.
    
    `screen`
        The screen to use. If not given, defaults to `name`.
    
    This returns an object that can have properties added to it. Properties
    are added using the method:
    
    
    .. method:: add_property(name)
    
        Registers a property with the creator-defined screen language statement. This
        returns the object it is called on, so calls can be chained.
