.. function:: renpy.displayable(d)
    
    This takes `d`, which may be a displayable object or a string. If it's 
    a string, it converts that string into a displayable using the usual 
    rules.

.. function:: renpy.focus_coordinates()
    
    This attempts to find the coordinates of the currently-focused
    displayable. If it can, it will return them as a (x, y, w, h)
    tuple. If not, it will return a (None, None, None, None) tuple.

.. function:: renpy.get_physical_size()
    
    Returns the size of the physical window.

.. function:: renpy.get_renderer_info()
    
    Returns a dictionary, giving information about the renderer Ren'Py is
    currently using. The dictionary has one required key:
    
    ``"renderer"``
        One of ``"gl"`` or ``"sw"``, corresponding to the OpenGL and
        software renderers, respectively.
    
    ``"resizable``
        True if and only if the window is resizable.
    
    Other, renderer-specific, keys may also exist. The dictionary should
    be treated as immutable. This should only be called once the display
    has been started (that is, after the init code is finished).

.. function:: renpy.get_say_attributes()
    
    Gets the attributes associated with the current say statement, or
    None if no attributes are associated with this statement.
    
    This is only valid when executing or predicting a say statement.

.. function:: renpy.get_side_image(tag)
    
    This attempts to find an image to show as the side image. It attempts to
    find an image that begins with tag, and matches side_image_attributes. It
    returns the name of the image (as a tuple of strings) if possible, or 
    None if that's not possible.

.. function:: renpy.image_size(im)
    
    Given an image manipulator, loads it and returns a (``width``,
    ``height``) tuple giving its size.
    
    This reads the image in from disk and decompresses it, without
    using the image cache. This can be slow.

.. function:: renpy.list_files(common=False)
    
    Lists the files in the game directory and archive files. Returns
    a list of files, with / as the directory separator.
    
    `common`
        If true, files in the common directory are included in the
        listing.

.. function:: renpy.notify(message)
    
    Causes Ren'Py to display the `message` using the notify screen. By
    default, this will cause the message to be dissolved in, displayed
    for two seconds, and dissolved out again.
    
    This is useful for actions that otherwise wouldn't produce feedback,
    like screenshots or quicksaves.
    
    Only one notification is displayed at a time. If a second notification
    is displayed, the first notification is replaced.    

.. function:: renpy.set_physical_size(size)
    
    Attempts to set the size of the physical window to size. This has the 
    side effect of taking the screen out of windowed mode.

.. function:: renpy.vibrate(duration)
    
    Causes the device to vibrate for `duration` seconds. Currently, this
    is only supported on Android.

.. function:: renpy.music.register_channel(name, mixer=None, loop=None, stop_on_mute=True, tight=False, file_prefix='', file_suffix='', buffer_queue=True)
    
    This registers a new audio channel named `name`. Audio can then be
    played on the channel by supplying the channel name to the play or
    queue statements.
    
    `mixer`
        The name of the mixer the channel uses. By default, Ren'Py
        knows about the "music", "sfx", and "voice" mixers. Using
        other names is possible, but may require changing the
        preferences screens.
    
    `loop`
        If true, sounds on this channel loop by default.
    
    `stop_on_mute`
        If true, music on the channel is stopped when the channel is muted.
        
    `tight`
        If true, sounds will loop even when fadeout is occuring. This should
        be set to True for a sound effects or seamless music channel, and False
        if the music fades out on its own.
    
    `file_prefix`
        A prefix that is prepended to the filenames of the sound files being
        played on this channel.
    
    `file_suffix`
        A suffix that is appended to the filenames of the sound files being
        played on this channel.
    
    `buffer_queue`
        Should we buffer the first second or so of a queued file? This should
        be True for audio, and False for movie playback.

.. function:: layout.yesno_screen(message, yes=None, no=None)
    
    This causes the a yes/no prompt screen with the given message
    to be displayed. The screen will be hidden when the user hits
    yes or no.
    
    `message`
        The message that will be displayed.
    
    `yes`
        An action that is run when the user chooses yes.
    
    `no`
        An action that is run when the user chooses no.
