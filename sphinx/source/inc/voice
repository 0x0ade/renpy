.. function:: voice(filename, tag=None)
    
    Plays `filename` on the voice channel. The equivalent of the voice
    statement.
    
    `filename`
        The filename to play. This is used with 
        :var:`config.voice_filename_format` to produce the 
        filename that will be played.
    
    `tag`
        If this is not None, it should be a string giving a 
        voice tag to be played. If None, this takes its
        default value from the voice_tag of the Character 
        that causes the next interaction.
    
        The voice tag is used to specify which character is 
        speaking, to allow a user to mute or unmute the 
        voices of particular characters.
