.. Automatically generated file - do not modify.

.. function:: renpy.can_load(filename, test=False)
    
    Returns true if `filename` exists as a save file, and False otherwise.

.. function:: renpy.list_saved_games(regexp='.', fast=False)
    
    Lists the save games. For each save game, returns a tuple containing:
    
    * The filename of the save.
    * The extra_info that was passed in.
    * A displayable that, when displayed, shows the screenshot that was
      used when saving the game.
    * The time the game was stayed at, in seconds since the UNIX epoch.
    
    `regexp`
        A regular expression that is matched against the start of the
        filename to filter the list.
    
    `fast`
        If fast is true, the filename is returned instead of the
        tuple.

.. function:: renpy.load(filename)
    
    Loads the game state from `filename`. This function never returns.

.. function:: renpy.rename_save(old, new)
    
    Renames a save from `old` to `new`.

.. function:: renpy.save(filename, extra_info='')
    
    Saves the game state to a save slot.
    
    `filename`
        A string giving the name of a save slot. Despite the variable name,
        this corresponds only loosely to filenames.
    
    `extra_info`
        An additional string that should be saved to the save file. Usually,
        this is the value of :var:`save_name`.
    
    :func:`renpy.take_screenshot` should be called before this function.

.. function:: renpy.take_screenshot(scale=None, background=False)
    
    Causes a screenshot to be taken. This screenshot will be saved as part of
    a save game.

.. function:: renpy.unlink_save(filename)
    
    Deletes the save with the given `filename`.
