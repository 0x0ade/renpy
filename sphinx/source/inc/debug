.. function:: renpy.get_filename_line()
    
    Returns a pair giving the filename and line number of the current
    statement.

.. function:: renpy.log(msg)
    
    If :var:`config.log` is not set, this does nothing. Otherwise, it opens
    the logfile (if not already open), formats the message to 70
    columns, and prints it to the logfile.

.. function:: renpy.watch(expression, style='default', **properties)
    
    This watches the given python expression, by displaying it in the
    upper-left corner of the screen (although position properties
    can change that). The expression should always be
    defined, never throwing an exception.
    
    A watch will not persist through a save or restart.
