.. function:: renpy.call(label, from_current=False, *args, **kwargs)
    
    Causes the current Ren'Py statement to terminate, and a jump to a
    `label` to occur. When the jump returns, control will be passed
    to the statement following the current statement.
    
    `from_current`
        If true, control will return to the current statement, rather than
        the statement following the current statement. (This will lead to
        the current statement being run twice.)

.. function:: renpy.return_statement()
    
    Causes Ren'Py to return from the current Ren'Py-level call.
