.. class:: MusicRoom(channel='music', fadeout=0.0, fadein=0.0, loop=False)
    
    A music room that contains a series of songs that can be unlocked
    by the user, and actions that can play entries from the list in
    order.
    
    `channel`
        The channel that this music room will operate on.
    
    `fadeout`
        The number of seconds it takes to fade out the old
        music when changing tracks.
        
    `fadein`
        The number of seconds it takes to fade in the new
        music when changing tracks.
    
    `loop`
        If true, a music track will loop once played. If False, it 
        will advance to the next track.

    .. method:: Next(self)
        
        An action that causes the music room to play the next unlocked file
        in the playlist.
    
    .. method:: Play(filename=None)
                    
        Causes the music room to start playing. If `filename` is given, that
        file begins playing. Otherwise, the currently playing file starts 
        over (if it's unlocked), or the first file starts playing.
        
        If `filename` is given, buttons with this action will be insensitive
        while `filename` is locked, and will be selected when `filename`
        is playing.
    
    .. method:: Previous(self)
        
        An action that causes the music room to play the previous unlocked 
        file in the playlist.
    
    .. method:: Stop(self)
        
        Stops the music.
    
    .. method:: add(filename, always_unlocked=False)
        
        Adds the music file `filename` to this music room. The music room
        will play unlocked files in the order that they are added to the
        room.
        
        `always_unlocked`
            If true, the music file will be always unlocked. This allows
            the file to show up in the music room before it has been 
            played in the game.
    
    .. method:: is_unlocked(filename)
        
        Returns true if the filename has been unlocked (or is always
        unlocked), and false if it is still locked.
