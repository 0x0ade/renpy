Skins
=====

Ren'Py supports skinning the launcher â€“ changing what the launcher
looks like. To do this, follow the following steps:

Skins are specific to the Ren'Py version in use, and can't be
expected to be forward or backwards compatible.

1. Open the launcher in the launcher. This can be done from the
   preferences screen.

2. Modify skin.rpy to skin the launcher. Place the image files you use
   into the launcher's game directory.

An incorrect skin.rpy file could prevent the launcher from
starting. To fix it, you'll need to remove skin.rpy and skin.rpyc from
the launcher's game directory, start the launcher, and then put them
back.
