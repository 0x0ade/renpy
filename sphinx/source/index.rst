Welcome to Ren'Py's documentation!
==================================

We're in the process of rewriting Ren'Py's documentation. While what
we have here is the most up-to-date documentation, it's also very
incomplete. To find out more about Ren'Py, please visit the Ren'Py
home page:

    http://www.renpy.org/

Much of Ren'Py is only documented in the older documentation, which is
stored in the Ren'Py Wiki:
