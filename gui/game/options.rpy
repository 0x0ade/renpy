## window title, and shows up in the interface and error reports.

define config.name = "Ren'Py 7 Default GUI"

## Sounds & Music


## These three variables control which mixers are shown to the player
## by default. Setting one of these to False will hide the appropriate
## mixer.

define config.has_sound = True
define config.has_music = True
define config.has_voice = True

## To allow the user to play a test sound on the sound or voice channel,
## uncomment a line below and use it to set a sample sound to play.

# define config.sample_sound = "sample-sound.ogg"
# define config.sample_voice = "sample-voice.ogg"


## Uncomment the following line to set an audio file that will be played
## while the player is at the main menu. This file will continue playing
## into the game, until it is stopped or another file is played.

# define config.main_menu_music = "main-menu-theme.ogg"


###############################################################################
## Transitions
##
## These variables set transitions that are used when certain events occur.
## Each variable should be set to a transition, or None to indicate that
## no transition should be used.

## Entering or exiting the game menu.

define config.enter_transition = dissolve
define config.exit_transition = dissolve


## A transition that is used after a game has been loaded.

define config.after_load_transition = None


## Used when entering the main menu after the game has ended.

define config.end_game_transition = None


## A variable to set the transition used when the game starts
## does not exist. Instead, use a with statement after showing
## the initial scene.

## Save directory

## This controls the platform-specific place Ren'Py will place the save
## files for this game. The save files will be placed in:
##
## Windows: %APPDATA\RenPy\<config.save_directory>
##
## Macintosh: $HOME/Library/RenPy/<config.save_directory>
##
## Linux: $HOME/.renpy/<config.save_directory>
##
## This generally should not be changed, and if it is, should always be a
## literal string, not an expression.

define config.save_directory = "gui-7"
